If one of our health care professionals, workers or employees should be directly exposed to your blood or body fluids in a way that may transmit disease, your blood will be tested for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (the “AIDS” virus), Covid-19, as well as for Hepatitis B and C.

MMW volunteers may not be able to provide you with all the services you need, but if you would like to consult with our volunteer team and receive the type of treatment being offered today, please read the patient waiver below very carefully.',

The more common complications include pain, swelling, bleeding, dry sockets, limited mouth opening, infection, bruising and discoloration of the skin, and temporary numbness and/or tingling of the lip, chin, teeth, or tongue.',

Sinus complications, which may occur from the removal of upper teeth, include a root tip or tooth in the sinus or development of a lingering opening into the sinus from the mouth, which could require sinus treatments following surgery. I understand Mission Minded Worldwide (MMW) does not provide or pay for any of these additional treatments.',
